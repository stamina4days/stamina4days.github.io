          <h3>One-Line Pitch</h3>
          <blockquote>
            A quiet, escalating record of what happens when observation stops
            being neutral—and becomes a force.

        <!-- SHORT DESCRIPTION -->

          <h3>Short Description</h3>
          <p>
            <em>Bound to Witness</em> unfolds as a sequence of controlled archival
            records. An Observer enters a contained world tasked to watch without
            interfering. At first, restraint feels like ethics. Then it becomes
            habit. Then it becomes evidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the distance between witness and influence collapses, the system
            begins to change around what it detects. Silence holds—until focus
            arrives. And once the world is being truly seen, it no longer behaves
            as if it can survive it.

        <!-- LONG DESCRIPTION -->
        <div class="book-card">
          <h3>Long Description</h3>
          <p>
            Written as a restrained sequence of reports,
            <em>Bound to Witness</em> examines the quiet violence of observation
            itself. An Observer is assigned to a closed system with a single rule:
            record, but do not intervene.
          </p>
          <p>
            What begins as ethical distance slowly transforms into complicity, as
            attention reshapes the world it claims only to witness. Responsibility
            gathers gradually, almost invisibly, until it becomes unavoidable.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the time the Observer understands the cost of watching, the system
            has already learned how to respond.

          <h3>About the Author</h3>
          <p>
            Prince Hubbard writes literary speculative fiction that explores
            systems, observation, belief, and consequence. His work favors quiet
            precision over spectacle, focusing on how responsibility accumulates—
            often unnoticed—until it alters both individuals and the structures
            surrounding them.
